# Chapter 1 - What is BIM?

## 1.1 - B.I.M. or BIM?

We never intended to write a book full of acronyms, but it is impossible to avoid the three-letter-word **BIM** which signifies both **[Building Information Modeling](https://www.notion.so/Building-Information-Modeling-d6a9102f542e43838fc77bced37a1c68)** and **Building Information Management**.

We want to stress that BIM is a very broad and deep subject, with multiple ways to look at it. In general, BIM, as the core subject of this course, focuses on digital information technologies, collaborative processes and their application in construction or infrastructure projects.

That is not a definition. Not yet. We want to first take a look back at the origin of the acronym itself.

# Some history

The acronym B.I.M. appeared around 2000 as a compromise within the context of **[Computer Aided Design (CAD)](https://www.notion.so/Computer-Aided-Design-c793db3067fa4e6c8cd294bc11c9715d)** At a time where most software vendors were in a transition from drawing and drafting oriented, mostly 2D CAD systems towards a model-based approach, several terms appeared. In Hungary, *[Graphisoft](https://www.notion.so/Graphisoft-43b047d3cf1f422691c2bc20a13d7dbb)* coined the term ”*virtual building*”, whereas the American *[Bentley](https://www.notion.so/Bentley-3169e2cd0b464461b75eee9dd17ca39d)* favored ”*integrated project modeling*” or ”*single building model*” and *[Autodesk](https://www.notion.so/Autodesk-97ebea883fb14fdf9fe42b430ebb4f76)* was using the term ”*building information modeling*” for a while.

In an unprecedented moment of industry collaboration, the American CAD- journalist and expert *Jerry Laiserin* succeeded to align the visions of these companies to adopt BIM as the main acronym to describe their comparable and related effort for a newer generation of CAD-software systems. At least for now, reminiscences of the **BIM Debate** are still readable online as part of the [Laiserin Letter](http://www.laiserin.com/features/bim/), in itself also quite unusual in the rather ephemeral medium that the internet has become.

So to be really clear: the term BIM was coined originally from the software side of the construction sector, as a way to promote newer and better ways to design and document buildings.

# What it means today?

Today, the term no longer matches the original meaning. Building Information Modelling is not just a better way to make drawings or 3D models. BIM is a methodology, a way of working for beyond the realms of the software system that is used to produce documents. It is possible to go through a complete course or training about BIM, without ever going in detail on software or file formats.

So in this course, we prefer to keep a broad view on BIM as a method to organise information in construction projects, where BIM-tools (for lack of a better word) are applied as the tools to support the method.

While the use of the acronym as qualifier for other concepts is sometimes frowned upon, we do occasionally talk about BIM-software, BIM-methods or BIM-processes. Even the term BIM-model is frequently used, although it may not be semantically correct. But as the term BIM has become adopted in the construction sector and the term has at least gained acceptance worldwide, we are not too concerned about this usage. Where it matters, though, we advise you to always be explicit. If the focus is on the management of information and related procedures, it is best to refer to *information management*, written in full. Where the focus is on the function or role, state this using a proper adjective, such as information manager, design and model coordinator or modeler, rather than the generic but utterly vague role of the BIM-manager.

So what do we see as the main drivers or accelerators behind BIM? Why is BIM important today and why does it make sense to push and promote the adoption of the BIM methodology?

Let’s distinguish two main aspects:

- On the one hand, the way the information in construction projects is organized. This is the subject of [Part 1](https://www.notion.so/Part-1-Process-4f7a1626277743669bea54dc87bfdde2).
- On the other hand, the usage and limitations of the technological tools that were traditionally applied in these projects. This is the subject of the other Parts of this course.
